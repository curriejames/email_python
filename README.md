**HOW IT WORKS**
- enter email and password for sender into the first and second set of quotes, respectively, for ```conn.login```

- ensure enter the **same email** for sender in both the first set of quotes inside the parentheses for ```conn.login``` and ```conn.sendmail```

- enter recipient email into the second set of quotes for ```conn.sendmail```

- enter text for subject line after the colon (:) symbol after the word 'Subject' inside the third set of quotes for ```conn.sendmail``` **but before** the double newlines (\n\n)

- enter email body text between the double newlines (\n\n) after the subject content **and before** the end quote for ```conn.sendmail```

That's all folks! Run the script == email sent!

**NEXT STEPS**
- add parallel code instructions for gmail and another popular email platform

- include as needed workaround instructions to successfully implement the code for gmail et cetera

- ensure viewers are greeted at some point with a prominent disclaimer/notice to avoid spamming and other questionable actions
